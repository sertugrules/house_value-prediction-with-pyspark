The notebook titled "House_Price Prediction with PySpark" by ErtuÄŸrul Sert is structured to guide the reader through a comprehensive house price prediction analysis using PySpark. The notebook is divided into several key sections, as summarized below:

Spark Session Starting and Uploading our Data: This section likely details the initial setup procedures for Spark, including the instantiation of a Spark session and loading the dataset used for the analysis.

Row count and Describe using for the understand the Data: This part provides an overview of the dataset, including the total number of rows and descriptive statistics to help understand the data's characteristics.

Seeing Null Values at each Columns: Identifies and documents the presence of null values in each column of the dataset.

Filling Null values with median: Describes the approach for handling missing data, specifically by filling null values with the median value of each column.

Outlier for total_rooms: Focuses on identifying and handling outliers in the total_rooms variable, which is critical for accurate price prediction.

Train and Test Data Split: Explains how the dataset is split into training and test sets, a crucial step in preparing the data for machine learning models.

Linear Regression Machine Learning and Performance Metrics: Presents the implementation and evaluation of a Linear Regression model, including the performance metrics used to assess its accuracy.

RandomForestRegressor Machine Learning model and Performance Models: Discusses the use of a Random Forest Regressor, another machine learning model, along with its performance evaluation.

Gradient Boosting Machine Learning Model and Performance metrics: Explores the application of a Gradient Boosting model for house price prediction and its performance assessment.

Additional sections on data pre-processing and model evaluation, including a focus on graphical predictions for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, and a detailed exploration of Gradient Boosting Tree Graphs.
